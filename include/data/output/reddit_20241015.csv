1g3zquw,Introducing the dbt Column Lineage Extractor: A Lightweight Tool for dbt Column Lineage,"Dear fellow data engineers,

I am an analytics/data engineer from Canva, and we are excited to share a new open-source tool that could be helpful for your dbt projects: the **dbt Column Lineage Extractor**! üõ†Ô∏è

## What is it?

The dbt Column Lineage Extractor is a lightweight Python-based tool designed to extract and analyze column-level lineage in your dbt projects. It leverages the [sqlglot](https://github.com/tobymao/sqlglot) library to parse and analyze SQL queries, mapping out the complex column lineage relationships within your dbt models.

## Why Use It?

While dbt provides model-level lineage, column-level lineage has been a highly requested feature. Although tools and vendors such as Atlan, dbt Cloud, SQLMesh, and Turntable offer column-level lineage, challenges like subscription fee, indexing delays, complexity, or concerns about sending organizational code/data to vendor servers limit their broader adoption. 

Furthermore, all these tools lack a programmatic interface, hindering further development and usage. For example, a programmatic interface for column-level lineage could facilitate the creation of automated tools for propagating sensitive column data tagging.


## Key Features

- **Column Level Lineage**: Extract lineage for specified model columns, including both direct and recursive relationships.
- **Integration Ready**: Output results in a human-readable JSON format, which can be programmatically integrated for use cases such as data impact analysis, data tagging, etc.; or visualized with other tools (e.g. [jsoncrack.com](https://jsoncrack.com/editor)).

## Installation

You can install the tool via pip:

```bash
pip install dbt-column-lineage-extractor
```

## Usage 

See the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/canva-public/dbt-column-lineage-extractor)

## Limitations

- Does not support certain SQL syntax (e.g., lateral flatten).
- Does not support dbt Python models.
- Has not yet been tested for dialects outside of `snowflake`.

## Get Involved

Check out the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/canva-public/dbt-column-lineage-extractor) for more details. Contributions and feedback are highly welcome!

1g43c4w,Help a junior data engineer left on his own,"Hi everyone,

As the title suggests, I'm a JDE without a senior to refer to.

I've been asked to propose an architecture on GCP to run an ""insurance engine.""

**Input**: About 30 tables on BigQuery, with a total of 5 billion rows  
**Output**: About 100 tables on BigQuery

The process needs to have two main steps:

1. **Pre-processing** -> Data standardization (simple SQL queries)
2. **Calculating the output tables** -> Fairly complex statistical calculations with many intermediate steps on the pre-processed tables

The confirmed technologies are Airflow as the orchestrator and Python as the programming language.

For the first point, I was thinking of using simple tasks with `BigQueryInsertJobOperator` and the queries in a `.sql` script, but I'm not really fond of this idea.  
What are the downsides of such a simple solution?  
One idea could be using DBT. Does it integrate well with Airflow? With DBT, a strong point would be the automatic lineage, which is appreciated. Any other pros?  
Other ideas?

For the second point, I was thinking of using Dataproc with PySpark. What do you think?

1g49ph4,Let‚Äôs talk about open compute + a workshop exploring it,"Hey folks, dlt cofounder here.

Open compute has been on everyone‚Äôs minds lately. It has been on ours too.

# Iceberg, delta tables, duckdb, vendor lock, what exactly is the topic?

Up until recently, data warehouses were closely tied to the technology on which they operate. Bigquery, Redshift, Snowflake and other vendor locked ecosystems. Data lakes on the other hand tried to achieve similar abilities as data warehouses but with more openness, by sticking to flexible choice of compute + storage.

What changes the dialogue today are a couple of trends that aim to solve the vendor-locked compute problem.

* File formats + catalogs would enable replicating data warehouse-like functionality while maintaining open-ness of data lakes.
* Ad-hoc database engines (DuckDB) would enable adding the metadata, runtime and compute engine to data

There are some obstacles. One challenge is that even though file formats like Parquet or Iceberg are open, managing them efficiently at scale still often requires proprietary catalogs. And while DuckDB is fantastic for local use, it needs an access layer which in a ‚Äúmulti engine‚Äù data stack this leads to the data being in a vendor space once again.

# The angles of focus for Open Compute discussion

* Save cost by going to the most competitive compute infra vendor.
* Enable local-production parity by having the same technologies locally as on cloud.
* Enable vendor/platform agnostic code and enable OSS collaboration.
* Enable cross-vendor-platform access within large organisations that are distributed across vendors.

# The players in the game

Many of us are watching the bigger players like Databricks and Snowflake, but the real change is happening across the entire industry, from the recently announced ‚Äúcross platform dbt mesh‚Äù to the multitude of vendors who are starting to use duckdb as a cache for various applications in their tools.

1g3yy2k,How Data Documentation Helped Me as a New Dev,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share a little about my experience using [dbdocs.io](http://dbdocs.io) for database documentation. As someone working in a team where communication between developers, database admins, and project managers is key, having clear and structured database documentation has been a game changer.

Before dbdocs, we had a mess of spreadsheets and scattered notes for documenting our database schemas. It was difficult to maintain, and any schema changes led to endless back-and-forths between team members. That's when we decided to give dbdocs and DBML (Database Markup Language) a try, and honestly, it's been a breath of fresh air.

Here‚Äôs a quick overview of how it works and why it‚Äôs been so helpful for us:

1. **Easy Setup**: Installing dbdocs and DBML took no time. With just a few commands, we were able to generate database documentation that‚Äôs not only clean but also shareable via a simple link.
2. **Automated Updates**: We integrated dbdocs into our CI/CD pipeline, so the database documentation updates automatically with every new change. This has been a lifesaver, especially during fast-moving projects.
3. **Collaboration**: Since dbdocs provides a shareable link, our non-technical team members can easily access and understand the database structure. No more confusion about how the data is stored and linked!
4. **Version Control**: One of the coolest features is tracking schema changes over time. We can look back at what‚Äôs changed and why, which helps us avoid unexpected surprises during updates.
5. **Customization**: We can add descriptions, notes, and relationships directly in the DBML file. It‚Äôs like having a living document that evolves with the database.

Using dbdocs has genuinely improved how our team handles database documentation. It‚Äôs simple, intuitive, and perfect for anyone who wants to stay organized and keep the team aligned.

If you're struggling with database documentation, I highly recommend giving dbdocs a shot. It‚Äôs been a game changer for us.

P/S: I work there, so I might be a little biased‚Äîbut it really has made our workflow a lot smoother!

1g3y58d,Am I really a Data Engineer?,"I work with data in a large US company. My title is something along the lines ‚ÄúSenior Consultant Engineer - Data Engineering‚Äù. I lead a team of a couple other ‚ÄúData Engineers‚Äù. I have been lurking in this sub reddit for a while now and it makes me feel like what you guys here call DE is not what we do.¬†



We don't have any sort of data warehouse, or prepare data for other analysts. We develop processes to ingest, generate, curate, validate and govern the data used by our application (and this data is on a good old transactional rdbms).¬†


We use Spark in Scala, run it on EMR and orchestrate it all with Airflow, but we don't really write pipelines. Several years ago we wrote basically one pipeline that can take third party data and now we just reuse that pipeline/framework¬† (with any needed modifications) whenever a new source of data comes in. Most of the work lately has been to improve the existing processes instead of creating new processes.¬†


We do not use any of the cool newer tools that you guys talk about all the time in this sub such as DBT or DuckDB.


Sometimes we just call ourselves Spark Developers instead of DE.


On the other hand, I do see myself as a DE because I got this job after a boot camp in DE (and Spark, Hadoop, etc is what they taught us so I am using what ‚Äúmade‚Äù me a DE to begin with).


I have tried incorporating duckDb in my workflow but so far the only use case I have for it is reading parquet files on my workstation since most other tools don't read parquet.


I also question the Senior part of my title and even how to best portray my role history (it  is a bit complicated - not looking for a review) but that is a topic for a different day.


TLDR: My title is in DE but we only use Spark and not even with one of the usual DE use cases.

I work for an SME who is now realising (after years of us complaining) that our data analysis solutions aren't working as we grow as a business and want to improve/overhaul it all.


They want to set up a Data Warehouse but, at present, the team consists of two Data Analysts and a lot of Web Developers. At present we have some AWS instances and use PowerBI as a front-end and basically all of our data is SQL, no unstructured or other types.


I know the principles of a Warehouse (I've read through Kimball) but never actually got behind the wheel and so was opting to go for a third party for assistance as I wouldn't be able to do a good enough or fast enough job.


Is there any Pitfalls you'd recommend keeping an eye out for? We've currently tagged Snowflake, DataBricks and Fabric as our use cases but evaluating pros and cons without that first hand experience a lot of discussion relies on, I feel a bit rudderless.

1g3rmvi,Best Approach For Streaming Data Enrichment,"Hello,

  
I have a unique situation where I need to enrich a ton of data in transit and render it in a dashboard.  The data I plan to enrich it with is also a tremendously large data set.  I've never done anything like this before, so I wanted to pick the collective Reddit brain and see if I'm on the right track.



For the sake of conversation, let's say I have a flat file of a billion customer addresses, with new ones being added and dropped all the time when customers join or leave my service, and a high volume stream of customer id's that could appear at random.  What's the best way to enrich this data?  The enrichment in question would essentially just be an inner join between each data source to add customer location info. Right now we are thinking Flink, with some kind of partitioning scheme for the flat file, which would be served up to Druid and Superset.  I see that Databricks has some support for streaming data, but there's very little info on the internet about its Flink-like abilities to enrich said data on the fly.  

  
Our preference would be for something like Databricks, since we have some experience with that/Spark on parallel teams, but ultimately we want the right tool for the job and are willing to commit the time and money to learn it and do it right.  Most of the technical documentation I've been using for Flink is 5-10 years old, so there's also some concern about investing a bunch of time in upskilling in an already niche tool, only to have some stupid simple Snowflake or Databricks tool come out next week.

I presume I'm more likely to see AWS in the wild but if it's green field what cloud would you choose to build DE infrastructure? 

For what it's worth I'm going to take either the Azure Data Engineer Assocoiate or the AWS Data Engineer Associate cert as a learning tool and to give me a study guide to work through and validate my knowledge.",1,1,Humble_Ostrich_4610,2024-10-15 09:49:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1g43xrm/looking_for_advice_manager_who_wants_to_get_back/,0,False,False,False,False
1g3rlyv,How Would You Build a Data Analytics Department From the Ground Up at a Small Company?,"Hi All,

I recently accepted a position at a small company where I'll be in charge of all things data. This will be my first job out of school. I'll have my degree in Information Systems and have taken some DE-specific classes (pipelines, warehousing, advanced SQL/Python). While I've designed and built some databases/pipelines in the past, I haven't built a full analytics system like this before.

We currently use a CRM for scheduling, sales, and billing that has an API available for pulling data. We will also need to store marketing data to hopefully gain some insights, but I'm not sure exactly what that will all look like. For context this company is in the Home Services Industry.

I‚Äôve had some initial thoughts on where to start, but I wanted to reach out for advice. Our budget is pretty tight, so cost-effective (or free) solutions would be ideal. Here are a few things I'm thinking about:

1. **Data storage:** Should I use something like Postgres on AWS (or supabase) or should I use something like Redshift/Snowflake? What are some of the better options that are low cost but would get the job done?
2. **Data Analysis/Visualizations:** What tools or processes would you recommend for analysis/visualizations? Should we use excel or branch out and pay for something like Tableau or Power BI?
3. **First steps:** What would be your first few steps when starting from scratch?
4. **General advice:** Any lessons you‚Äôve learned in similar situations or things I should watch out for?

1g3oj3p,Stuck between coding and stability: navigating career choices towards a data engineering future,"Hi,

I have a PhD in applied math (simulation, high-performance computing; Fortran, data analysis with Python, gitlab, Linux).

After university, I had a position for 3 years with focus on Python backend development but I also did some DevOps tasks and some consulting for custom analytics projects using the in-house SaaS software I also developed.

I got fed up with the first company and found a job as a data engineer at a huge international non-tech corp (7 months in now). Beforehand, I got really interested in DE and read a lot, plus did some side projects/certs. The role description included Python and Azure, but teams changed and now I am doing SAP BW4HANA, Alteryx and some MS SQL. It is more a BI developer position rather than a DE position. Major task is to extract data for the reporting frontend from the DWH. I actually really like the company, my team and also my manager, plus the payment and everything else is really nice.

However, I miss coding a lot and I think the tech stack is not only outdated, but I also dislike no/low-code tools. Now I want to get another position, but stay in the company. They have some open Python positions currently (cloud, dev ops mostly), but also several low-programming IT roles I find interesting in principle (e.g. process mining, DS). On the other hand, I wonder whether I should look elsewhere in order to not risk wasting too much time on this tech stack in case I cannot switch soon. Staying in the same position for a while would be acceptable in case this does not really pose a risk for getting an actual DE job in the future.

My problem is that I cannot really decide what to go for. I would actually try one of the low-programming, but complex closer-to-business IT roles, but I am afraid that this is a way of no return afterwards. On the other hand, I am somehow afraid that the coding roles are more prone to offshoring/AI in the long term.

It is hard to judge for me what would be the best long-term strategy for career/job safety, given my background. I consistently got very good feedback in my roles so far, and I am also good with soft skills, but unsure whether to pursue a manager position, as I really like coding/developing. Besides that, I recently bought a house, got a child, and thus value stability and WLB.

Maybe important: I am living in central EU and the job market is not as bad as in the US.

Also, I somehow feel pressured about when to take action, as I don't want to let too much time pass in a non-optimal position. However, rushing it would probably be bad, too.

I would be very happy about some feedback!",1,0,Dunhal,2024-10-14 19:33:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1g3oj3p/stuck_between_coding_and_stability_navigating/,0,False,False,False,False
1g3nv0s,Advice about education to help with move to DE,"Hello. During COVID, I was unemployed and took a lot of courses on edx and Coursera. I first started in data analysis and data science but realized my interest is DE. I even had a project where used an API and got the the data into a database in created. 

I'm now working as a BI Analyst. I initially started building dashboards, but now most of my work is in SQL creating or improving datasets we need. I know a bit of python and (used for API project too) use it mostly to do some repetitive tasks a bit faster.  

My undergrad is MIS. I've been offered to have a UK Masters paid for me. I was thinking about doing a conversion computer science masters. However, I'm not sure if it's worth leaving Canada for a year since I don't have any interest in living/working in the UK. I've looked into Canada's part-time education options, but I'd have to take out a loan of some sort and risk not getting the opportunity for co-op.

1g3n3ug,Need ideas and best practices for updating and maintaining tables after normalizing them. ,"Hi, I am an analyst who was recently tasked to build one of our database which contains of mainly raw data, cross walks, and tables used for reports.

What I had done was normalize the raw tables by running a sql query and inserting that data into new dim and facts tables. 

My question is, how and what are good practices to maintain and update these tables? I am thinking of schedule jobs to rerun those sql queries that normalized the raw table and appending new (non-duplicate) data into the dim and facts table. Is this thinking correct?

I‚Äôm currently using SQL Server, SSIS, Dapper, and once in a while, Powershell (mainly because my supervisor likes to use Powershell).

Currently working as cloudera Hadoop admin.

Mainly worked realtime streaming pipelines good understanding Kafka apache spark, Docker, Kubernetes.

Good knowledge on azure and AWS cloud.

Completed azure data engineer DP203 & AWS solution architect associate.

Now I'm planning to switch to data engineering domain.

From last one year my manager didn't change my role and promotion. He keep on postponing when I tried to ask him.

Currently we have small team with big project and more work. My manager is not hiring right candidates.

He is literally torchering me to work on weekends & whenever team needed help. I'm totally helpless.

I'm thinking of to resign and apply for new roles in data domain.
As of now I don't have offers in hand & I need to serve 3 month's notice period in my current organisation.


Please share your thoughts.

1g3ml2b,[AMA] Sharing a new approach to do unstructured data engineering,"I‚Äôve been feeling how much of a pain it is when unstructured data has to go through a complex ETL pipeline before landing in a data warehouse. You‚Äôre forced to define every schema upfront. If you realize later that you need something different, it means reworking the pipeline, which often leads to breaking existing schemas.

**What if we flipped the process?**

Instead of pushing unstructured data through a long ETL pipeline, what if we moved the data engineering to happen *after* it lands in a data lake or warehouse? The idea is to store unstructured data and extract information when it‚Äôs needed‚Äîallowing flexibility to define schemas later.

Here is an idea of what it looks like.

>Disclaimer: This is our product to illustrate this idea more clearly but I'll not disclose its name.

https://preview.redd.it/ih129qc4frud1.png?width=3302&format=png&auto=webp&s=f761aac9908389dfd14704146d2d736624385ff5

How it works behind the scene

* Files like PDFs are stored in object storage or cloud drives.
* The files in these storages can be directly using SQL, treating them like tables.
* SQL functions can extract structured insights from file columns into new JSON columns
* Since prompts can get messy, users can define what they want to do about unstructured data in a friendly user interface and refer to it as an agent in the SQL query

Just like structured data ELT, the premise of unstructured data ELT is that the scale of computing and the cost can justify the ROI, and thanks to LLM's smaller size, we believe that day is unbelievably close
