1g4vwsm,"Data Analyst vs Data Engineer — Stuck in My Current Role, Need Advice","Hi everyone,

I’m seeking some career guidance as I’m feeling a bit stuck and unsure of my next move.

I’ve been working at a service-based company for nearly 6 years (will complete 6 years in 3 months). My current role is as a Database Administrator, mainly working with IBM Db2, and I also have some experience in data analysis. I’m proficient in SQL and Python, but I’ve realized that I haven’t had much exposure beyond that in my current organization, and it’s starting to hold me back.

I’m now looking to switch careers but am confused about whether to pursue a role as a **Data Analyst** or a **Data Engineer**. I know that both of these paths would require me to learn more than just SQL and Python, and I’m ready to upskill, but I’m unsure which path would be the best fit for me in the long run.

Has anyone else been in a similar position? Which role has more growth potential, and what additional skills should I focus on learning for each path? I would really appreciate any insights or advice from those of you who have experience in either of these fields.

Thanks in advance for your help!",7,12,Impossible_Classic21,2024-10-16 10:11:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1g4vwsm/data_analyst_vs_data_engineer_stuck_in_my_current/,0,False,False,False,False

1g58lov,Data Engineering Grad Student Advice ,"
Hello Everyone I’m looking for some advice from Engineers :)

I am going back school for a technical master’s degree.  My main career goal is to become a Data Engineer.

Currently, I have a few years of experience as a Business System Analyst. Here’s a few questions I have for Data Engineers: 


1.) Would you choose a Computer Science, Data Science or Management Information Systems degree? 

2.) What certifications do you recommend?

3.) Should I focus on a graduate degree, certifications, or work experience in this field? 

4.) How do you stand out to contractors?

1g4uh4r,Choosing the Right SQL Server Edition and Understanding Backend Data Engineering Costs,"Hello, I'm the first data hire at my company, handling everything from analysis to predictions; basically anything data-related falls under me. We've been in operation for about three years, and while the data volume is still manageable, it's growing rapidly. Currently, we rely heavily on Excel, but we are planning to transition to Microsoft SQL Server soon.

I'm also enrolled in the IBM Data Engineering course, so I'm learning and implementing new skills as I go. For my day-to-day tasks, I mostly use Power BI and Python.

I have two main questions:

Which SQL Server edition should we go for; Standard or Enterprise? We are budgeting, and I need to recommend the right option based on our needs.

What other costs should I anticipate beyond the server? I'm trying to understand the full scope of backend data engineering work; from setup to long-term maintenance. Any insights on licensing, storage, tools, or additional infrastructure costs would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance!

Kindly note that I'm new to data engineering at its core, so if my questions sound a bit amateur, I do apologize.

I would like to first mention that, after reading the rules, this is not a simple ""please fill in my survey"" post!   
  
Although I am using the medium of a form, I think that this is one of the subreddit that contains the most focused / concentrated amount of people who are dedicated to the topic of Business Intelligence and Data Engineer.  
  
Through this, I would like to understand more about the Business Intelligence industry (as I come from design standpoint) & its many personas who work on various different sections of the business.  
  
The form dives deeper into the softwares used, main functionalities needed and the core problems that come up on a daily basis for someone in the industry, as it has been created after some time of self-research on the subject.

1g5b1lp,[SQL] How can I create two streams for low and high latency data meanwhile ensuring data is aligned? ,"I'm a one person band in a medium size company.
I'm the guy in charge of data, thus I support with spreadsheets and create very rudimentary pipelines.

I need to put together some data pipelines that can enable different teams to browse either fresh low latency data or historical high latency data, however the focus is ensuring that the data is 100% aligned.

Without having access to any specific tool or myself having any excellent skill ( for example I cannot do python), how can I achieve the above with just SQL and without having to store the same code twice?

For example, if I have a very basic sales KPI which is
Select 
CustomerID
,channel
,item
, country 
,sum(sales)
From data.warehouse.sales.events
Group by 1,2,3,4

How can I with just one SQL code ( to ensure data alignment and reduce maintenance) crate two streams, one with views for low latency and the second one with partitioned tables for 3years of KPI history?

I have one question regarding creating data engineering flow/pipeline, but i'll use my personal case.

 

""I am single data analyst/data engineer in my department where 20% of data i am getting is coming from larger databases (REDLake mostly) or API's , while 80% of data is coming from different excel tables/files that i do ETL in various programs and then visualise.

 

Is there really a point in creating Data Engineering pipeline/system for my use case?

 

What are the benefiets if the answer is yes?

 

The only use case for me in my eyes is if i get more people in my team doing the same/similar job as me...

1g51o7z,True?,"I found this post on LinkedIn by Zach Willson, what do you think?

  
I hate to say it but product manager is the safest role from AI. 



""Data engineer will feel pressure. 

Analytics engineer will feel less pressure. 

Data scientist will feel even less pressure. 

PM will be elevated. 

CEO will be put on the stratosphere. 



Why is PM so safe? 



Strategic roles that involve tons of in person interaction are the safest roles. CEO and founder are also extremely safe from being disrupted. PMs act like mini CEOs over their product areas. 



Roles that are closer to the business that require more interfacing with stakeholders are safer than roles that are “behind-the-scenes.” 



This is why I believe analytics engineer roles are safer than data engineer roles. 



Analytics engineers are closer to the business and require more business acumen to be good at while data engineer roles require more technicals. Technicals are what is getting commoditized by AI.
