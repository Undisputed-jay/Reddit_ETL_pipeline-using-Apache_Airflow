1g4mkz4,Some advice for job seekers from someone on the other side,"
Hopefully this helps some. I’m a principal with 10 YOE and am currently interviewing people to fill a senior level role. Others may chime in with differing viewpoints.

Something I keep seeing is that applicants keep focusing on technical skills. That’s not what interviewers want to hear unless it’s specifically a tech screen. You need to focus on business value.

Data is a product - how are you modeling to create a good UX for consumers? How are you building flexibility to make writing queries easier?  What processes are you automating to take repetitive work off the table?

If you made it to me then I assume you can write Python and sql. The biggest thing we’re looking for is understanding the business and applying value - not a technical know it all who can’t communicate with data consumers. Succinctness is good. I’ll ask follow up questions on things that are intriguing. Look up BLUF (bottom line up front) communication and get to the point. 

If you need to practice mock interviews, do it. You can’t really judge a book by its cover but interviewing is basically that. So make a damn good cover.

Curious what any other people conducting interviews have seen as trends.",148,33,molodyets,2024-10-16 00:19:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1g4mkz4/some_advice_for_job_seekers_from_someone_on_the/,0,False,False,False,False

1g4vwsm,"Data Analyst vs Data Engineer — Stuck in My Current Role, Need Advice","Hi everyone,

I’m seeking some career guidance as I’m feeling a bit stuck and unsure of my next move.

I’ve been working at a service-based company for nearly 6 years (will complete 6 years in 3 months). My current role is as a Database Administrator, mainly working with IBM Db2, and I also have some experience in data analysis. I’m proficient in SQL and Python, but I’ve realized that I haven’t had much exposure beyond that in my current organization, and it’s starting to hold me back.

I’m now looking to switch careers but am confused about whether to pursue a role as a **Data Analyst** or a **Data Engineer**. I know that both of these paths would require me to learn more than just SQL and Python, and I’m ready to upskill, but I’m unsure which path would be the best fit for me in the long run.

Has anyone else been in a similar position? Which role has more growth potential, and what additional skills should I focus on learning for each path? I would really appreciate any insights or advice from those of you who have experience in either of these fields.

1g58lov,Data Engineering Grad Student Advice ,"
Hello Everyone I’m looking for some advice from Engineers :)

I am going back school for a technical master’s degree.  My main career goal is to become a Data Engineer.

Currently, I have a few years of experience as a Business System Analyst. Here’s a few questions I have for Data Engineers: 


1.) Would you choose a Computer Science, Data Science or Management Information Systems degree? 

2.) What certifications do you recommend?

3.) Should I focus on a graduate degree, certifications, or work experience in this field? 

4.) How do you stand out to contractors?

1g4uh4r,Choosing the Right SQL Server Edition and Understanding Backend Data Engineering Costs,"Hello, I'm the first data hire at my company, handling everything from analysis to predictions; basically anything data-related falls under me. We've been in operation for about three years, and while the data volume is still manageable, it's growing rapidly. Currently, we rely heavily on Excel, but we are planning to transition to Microsoft SQL Server soon.

I'm also enrolled in the IBM Data Engineering course, so I'm learning and implementing new skills as I go. For my day-to-day tasks, I mostly use Power BI and Python.

I have two main questions:

Which SQL Server edition should we go for; Standard or Enterprise? We are budgeting, and I need to recommend the right option based on our needs.

What other costs should I anticipate beyond the server? I'm trying to understand the full scope of backend data engineering work; from setup to long-term maintenance. Any insights on licensing, storage, tools, or additional infrastructure costs would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance!

1g4lm6o,Combining Source Data at the Final Layer,"My organization has a lot of data sources and currently, all of our data marts are setup exclusively by source.

We are now being asked to combine the data from multiple sources for a few subject areas. The problem is, we cannot change the existing final views as they sit today.

My thought would be to just create an additional layer on top of our current data marts that combines the requested data together across multiple sources. If the performance is too poor in a view, then we'd have to set up an incremental load into tables and then build views on top of that which I still don't see as an issue.



Has anyone seen this type of architecture before? All of my google searching and I haven't seen this done anywhere yet. It looks like Data Vault is popular for this type of thing but it also looks like the data sources are normally combined at the start of the transformation process and not at the end.

1g4l3wz,Looking for a Code-Centric Alternative to Azure Data Factory for Remote Data Extraction,"Hi Reddit,

We want to replace Azure Data Factory (ADF) with a more code-centric tool, ideally focused on Python.

ADF’s key advantage for us is managing extraction jobs and loading data into Snowflake from a cloud interface.  
  
ADF does a great job of having an agent behind their firewall on their network, allowing us to manage the pipelines remotely.   
  
This is critical.

I’d love to move to a solution that lets us create, modify, run, and manage Python jobs in the cloud via an agent or similar setup.   
  
Any suggestions for tools that could replace ADF in this way?

This is the classic problem I have where I just don’t quite know what to type into Google/ Amazon to get what I’m after so hoping for some suggestions. 

I’ve read fundamentals of data engineering and part way through building data intensive applications which are great. I’m in a role where I’m leading a very small engineering and analytics team in a company that unfortunately, is woefully lacking on technical expertise despite aspiring to be a ‘tech business’. I have some decent sway in the business so wanting to step more into this gap to help steer decisions on things like:

- web analytics tools like posthog etc
- CDPs (we currently have an underutilised segment and customer.io setup that was put in by some consultants but no one really manages it)
- integrating various SaaS platforms between our website, Hubspot, Stripe payments, delivery/ fulfilment system (all horribly manual with excels everywhere). Again, our consultants setup what seems to be a decent c# suite of integrations but we’re looking at event grid or other systems that can help with observability

My team and I already hit apis for data, we use databricks, python etc so we can see opportunities to receive webhooks from system a and hit a post endpoint of system b to automate a step that is currently a horrible manual task however, we’re aware of how much potential work there is if we’re not careful. 

Do we use a SaaS product or do we try use Azure logic apps/ event grid. 

How many changes/ updates might we need to handle too, what if something

How would we handle schema changes, process changes etc

I hate to say it but product manager is the safest role from AI. 



""Data engineer will feel pressure.

Data scientist will feel even less pressure. 

PM will be elevated. 

CEO will be put on the stratosphere. 



Why is PM so safe? 



Strategic roles that involve tons of in person interaction are the safest roles. CEO and founder are also extremely safe from being disrupted. PMs act like mini CEOs over their product areas. 



Roles that are closer to the business that require more interfacing with stakeholders are safer than roles that are “behind-the-scenes.” 



This is why I believe analytics engineer roles are safer than data engineer roles. 



Analytics engineers are closer to the business and require more business acumen to be good at while data engineer roles require more technicals. Technicals are what is getting commoditized by AI.
